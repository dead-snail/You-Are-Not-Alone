## You Are Not Alone - 

- This is my entry to the 8th Brackey's Game Jam (if I can manage to finish it on time)
- I'm on holiday - don't give me shit 
- I'm probably just going to work on this as an actual project instead of releasing this for the jam.
- I also have nowhere to work and sitting on the floor is a surpisingly difficult location to code in.
- I just did three hours worth of planning, I'm not going to be able to submit this on time

# Ideas

> Story
- Start in Stage 1  with 10HP
- Josephine can hear you (but you don't know that)
- You make your way through a maze of rooms
- You find Josephine (or not) and she attempts to charge at you
- You die and go back to the start or you find the exit room
- You have to get Josephine to run into a wall to stun her while you escape down a tunnel.
- If you stop moving, she will get you
