## You Are Not Alone - 

- This is my entry to the 8th Brackey's Game Jam (if I can manage to finish it on time)
- I'm on holiday - don't give me shit 
- I'm probably just going to work on this as an actual project instead of releasing this for the jam.
- I also have nowhere to work and sitting on the floor is a surpisingly difficult location to code in.
- I just did three hours worth of planning, I'm not going to be able to submit this on time

# Ideas

> Maze
- Top down horror game
- Generated maze/dungeon
- escape the labyrinth by finding a piece of your soul and fighting the monster in each level

> Enemies
- All enemies can hear your movements and opening doors
- Enemies move towards the room you are in if they hear you

> Enemy - minotaur
- Referred to as "Josephine"
- Enemy moves randomly through the maze slowly
- If the player moves into the room the enemy is in, the enemy attempts to charge the player
- The charge can break some walls that the player can't
- If it is charging, it cannot change directions until it hits something or changes rooms

> Enemy - Wizard
- Referred to as "MAGE"
- Knows where you are without you making sounds 
- If the wizard sees the player, it first attempts to freeze it
- The ice summon bolt can bounce off one wall - has no maximum range
- The ice bolt slows the player but cannot break walls

> Player
- Referred to as "PLAYER"
- Player moves with WASD
- Player has to avoid the enemy
- The player has to get to find their 

> Doors 
- Doors have a chance to make a creaking sound when opened which attracts the enemy
- (?)Some doors could be fake
- oil can stop doors from creaking (has a max usage)

> Lore
- Existence: A magic world which few people to access different powers such as flight, telekinesis, reality warping, and immense strength (see more in powers.txt). 
- Player: A child who was found by the ruler of the world
