## You Are Not Alone

- This is my entry to the 8th Brackey's Game Jam (if I can manage to finish it on time)
- I'm on holiday - don't give me shit 
- I'm probably just going to work on this as an actual project instead of releasing this for the jam.
- I also have nowhere to work and sitting on the floor is a surpisingly difficult location to code in.

# Ideas

- Maze
> Top down horror game
> Generated maze/dungeon

- Enemy
> Refered to as Murphy
> Enemy moves randomly through the maze slowly
> If the player moves into the room the enemy is in, the enemy attempts to charge the player
> The charge can break some walls that the player can't
> Enemy can hear certain sounds (footsteps, doors opening) when the player is near it

- Player
> Player moves with WASD
> Player has to avoid the enemy
> The player has to get to a sword in the centre of the maze

- Doors 
> Doors have a chance to make a creaking sound when opened which attracts the enemy
> (?)Some doors could be fake
