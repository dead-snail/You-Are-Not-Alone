# Stages

| Stage | Description | Items | Soul | Monster | Notes |
| :---: | :---------: | :---: | :--: | :-----: | :---:
| 1 | The Labyrinth.<br />You move through a maze of rooms while the minotaur hears your every move. She can hear your footsteps and when she finds you, she will attack. You must find the part of your soul to escape her. | Bandages, trip wire, oil can | Super Speed | Minotaur | There are three paths which link to one-another until the exit room. |
| 2 | The Ice Cave.<br />Locked in place by an evil mage, you must wait for him to leave to look for your broken soul, but you must return to the cave before he returns, or he may storm the cave in search of you. Make it to the exit, and you will be met by a fierce fight... | ~ | Telekenesis | Wizard | The wizard keeps your shattered soul in a pouch so you must steal it from him.
| 3 | The Fire Dungeon.<br />Dash between floating platforms while paying mind to dodging traps located in the floor, as to not awaken the fiery beast hidden beneath you. | ~ | Regeneration | Phoenix | ~ |
| 4 | Murphy.<br />Murphy didn't like what happened to her phoenix. She has 4 stages: each using one of the previous monsters' powers - regening to 15HP each time. Once you beat these stages, you knock her crown off, which you can destroy and find the last piece of your soul. The last stage should be hard as Murphy starts to spray random attacks at a faster rate. | ~ | Teleportation | Murphy | ~ |
